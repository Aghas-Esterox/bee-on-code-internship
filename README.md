# Bee-On-Code Internship Projects

This repository contains two front-end projects completed during my internship at **Bee-On-Code**.  
The internship focused on modern web development using **React.js** and **Next.js**.


## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **React.js**
- **Next.js**
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** (depending on the project)
- **Tailwind CSS**, **SCSS**, or other styling tools
- **Component-based architecture**

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

These projects were built to:
- Strengthen my skills in React.js and Next.js
- Practice building scalable, maintainable front-end applications
- Learn and apply real-world development techniques in a team setting

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- Each project has its own README with setup and usage instructions.
- These are not production-ready apps but solid practice projects that demonstrate progress and learning during the internship.

## ðŸ“ž Contact
